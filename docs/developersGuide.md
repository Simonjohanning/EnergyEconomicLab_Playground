# Developers guide

Due to the considerable scope of the software project that this prototype envisions, considerable collaborative effort is needed. 
In order to incentivize this, this guide addresses other developers joining in in the effort to create the research infrastructure for an energy economics lab. 

This guide focuses on the technical aspects, architecture and structure of the LabChain in order to ease the introduction of other developers to this project.
