# Developers guide

Due to the considerable scope of the software project that this prototype envisions, considerable collaborative effort is needed. 
In order to incentivize this, this guide addresses other developers joining in in the effort to create the research infrastructure for an energy economics lab. 

This guide focuses on the technical aspects, architecture and structure of the LabChain in order to ease the introduction of other developers to this project.

The project uses [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/Simonjohanning/EnergyEconomicLab_Playground) for continuous integration and is documented with TypeDoc.
The documentation is split between the in-code documentation and the non-formal documentation in the respective markdown files. 
In-code documentation is to be done in the files with the respective tags, with the rendered documentation to be held outside of the repository (i.e. generated locally). 


Prospective developers are highly recommended to join the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/EnergyEconomics_LabChain/community) of the project for support and coordination.
